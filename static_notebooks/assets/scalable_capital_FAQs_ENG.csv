Please only submit the form to us by e-mail as described. Custody account transfers initiated by your house bank cannot be accepted.

Please note that the entire process may take several weeks until the transfer is complete."
English,Broker,Account opening,Is there a minimum deposit?,"You will select an amount for your initial deposit during the registration process. This amount must be at least 1 Euro.

English,Broker,Account opening,Can I become a customer even though I do not live in Germany?,"Yes. If you do not live in Germany but would still like to use our broker, you can become a customer if you meet the following conditions:

English,Broker,Account opening,Do I have to provide my tax ID?,"German Tax Liability:
No. Providing your tax ID at sign-up is optional if you are only liable for taxation in Germany. If you do not have your tax ID at hand, the custodian bank will automatically request it for you from the Federal Central Tax Office. Your capital gains tax will therefore be paid out correctly and automatically for you even if you do not provide your tax ID.

Non-German Tax Liability:
Yes. It is mandatory to provide your tax ID, also known as Tax Identification Number or ""TIN,"" if you are liable for tax in a country other than Germany. This also applies if you pay taxes in several countries, including Germany."

The current account must be in your name and must be held at a bank in the SEPA area. It must also be an account for payment transactions. For example, savings and overnight deposit accounts are not permitted. If your current account is a joint account, you must be registered as the beneficial owner."
English,Broker,Account opening,Why do I need to verify my identity?,"The Money Laundering Act (MLA) requires us to identify our customers. This identification is also in your interest, as it ensures a higher level of security in the customer relationship.

An MLA-compliant identification is carried out conveniently via POSTIDENT video, online identification using your ID (eID), or in the traditional way at your post office.

Do you have an NFC-enabled smartphone and a new ID card with a PIN? Then we recommend online identification with your ID (eID). With this option, you can identify yourself around the clock and in less than two minutes."
English,Broker,Account opening,Which identification methods are available?,"The identification is done by our partner, POSTIDENT. With POSTIDENT, you can choose between POSTIDENT video, online identification using your ID (eID), and identification in person at a post office branch.

You can start the identification process conveniently in our app or online by logging in to your Scalable Capital account after completing the registration."

English,Broker,Account opening,Is it possible to have multiple accounts?,"No. You can only have one brokerage account with a custody account in your name. However, as a broker client you have the option of adding an automated, ETF-based asset management portfolio. To do this, click on the ""plus"" in the app in the customer area after logging in (""Home"") or on ""Add product"" in the web browser. "
English,Broker,Account opening,Can I open an account with a foreign currency?,No. Trading via Scalable Broker is only possible in Euro.
English,Broker,Securities account management,How can I make deposits and withdrawals?,"Deposit
By clicking on the menu item ""Payments"", you can order a deposit at any time in our app or online. This will be debited from your current account via SEPA direct debit.
 
Alternatively, you can transfer the desired amount to your clearing account at Baader Bank. You will find the IBAN of your clearing account by selecting the desired product on the home screen and clicking the IBAN below the product title on the broker details screen. You can enter your name as the recipient, since the clearing account is in your name. Transfers to your clearing account at Baader Bank have to be made through your regular reference account. Payments that cannot be clearly associated with you (such as payments made through PayPal, Payward or Wise) are not allowed. 
 
Please note that deposits made through SEPA direct debit can only be used for trading derivatives eight weeks later.
 
Withdrawal
By clicking on the menu item ""Payments"", you can order a withdrawal at any time in our app or online. Simply select the desired amount and confirm your withdrawal. We will transfer this to the current account that you saved as your reference account.
"
English,Broker,Securities account management,Why can't my entire balance be paid out?,"We continuously calculate your available credit in real time. For example, the amount is reduced by open, not yet executed or not yet settled purchase orders or payments.

Proceeds from executed sales can be used directly to buy securities again. However, they are only available for payment as soon as the transactions have been booked by the custodian bank. This is due to the fact that securities transactions are only actually booked two trading days after the trade has taken place on the stock exchange (so-called settlement)."
English,Broker,Securities account management,"As a customer, do I have an overview of the individual transactions?","Yes. All transactions can be viewed at any time in our app or online by logging in to your Scalable Capital account. In addition, the custodian bank will provide you with a monthly account statement in your mailbox. There you will see a summary of all transactions made."
English,Broker,Securities account management,Why is my return not displayed in percentage?,"In addition to the real-time valuation of your portfolio, we also show you the absolute return in Euro. A percentage return on a portfolio basis is in many cases misleading, as it depends heavily on the timing of trading activities and their size.

It is possible to calculate the percentage return in relation to the total deposits made (minus withdrawals); however, this figure offers limited information as this example illustrates:

Assume you invest 10,000 Euro once through Scalable Broker. After one year your investments have generated an absolute return of 700 Euro. This would now result in a relative return of 7.0% and would be a meaningful indication. However, if you invested another 10,000 Euro on the same day, your percentage return would be halved - without changing the value of your investments (700 / 20,000 = 3.5%).

The time-weighted yield which we also use in wealth management can offer little help here. This is adjusted for incoming and outgoing payments thus allowing a direct comparison with a benchmark or another portfolio.

In wealth management, it is important to show the performance of the wealth manager transparently and independently of the client's investment dates. When evaluating one's own investment decisions, on the other hand, timing in particular plays a very decisive role in investment success. Therefore, the time-weighted return is not suitable in the context of Scalable Broker."
English,Broker,Securities account management,Can I use multibanking programs or a FinTS interface?,"Baader Bank, the custodian bank, offers a FinTS interface for multibanking programs. The LogIn data for FinTS access corresponds to your login data for the Baader customer portal. Depending on your software, you may need to enter the following address in the banking software: https://fints.baaderbank.de"
English,Broker,Securities account management,Can I export information about my portfolio such as a CSV file?,No. An export is not possible at this time.
English,Broker,Securities account management,How can I add securities to my watchlist?,"First, click on the desired security. Then, click on ""Add to watchlist"" (appears as a star in the app) in the upper right corner of the overview page of the security. The security will now appear in the watchlist on your home page. Securities for which you have already instructed orders or set up a savings plan are automatically added to your portfolio list."
English,Broker,Securities account management,How can I remove securities from my watchlist?,"First, click on the desired security. Then, click on ""Remove from watchlist"" (appears as a star in the app) in the upper right corner of the overview page of the security. When you buy a security from your watchlist, or set up a savings plan, it is automatically transferred from the watchlist to the portfolio list."

English,Broker,Trading,What are ETFs?,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that replicate the performance of a stock market index, such as the DAX, without a fund manager making active investment decisions. They are therefore also known as passive index funds. Like an investment fund, an ETF gives you access to a broader set of securities. such as stocks. Unlike actively managed investment funds, however, they are much more cost-effective, because they do not require expensive management fees or premiums that eat up your return. Since ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, they also offer daily liquidity. In short: ETFs enable broadly diversified and cost-effective investments."
English,Broker,Trading,What are stocks?,"Stocks are securities issued by companies to raise equity capital and represent a share in the equity capital of a company. A shareholder is therefore not a creditor as with a bond, but a co-owner of the company. The shareholder is involved in the economic success and failure, and the shareholder participates in it through profit distributions known as dividends as well as through the price development of the share.

English,Broker,Trading,Can I pay out sales proceeds immediately after selling securities?,"Earnings from executed sales can be used directly to buy securities again. However, they are only available for payment once the trades have been booked by the custody bank.

English,Broker,Trading,Can I reinvest sales proceeds immediately after selling securities?,"Proceeds from sell orders will become available immediately after order execution less a deduction to account for possible taxes.

English,Broker,Trading,What happens if trading is suspended?,"In very volatile market phases or in the case of announcements that strongly influence the price of one or more securities, the Exchange Supervisory Authority may suspend trading in individual securities. In extreme situations, the entire exchange trading may also be suspended. During this time, trading in the securities concerned is not possible.

In addition, securities may also be suspended from trading for an extended period of time for other reasons. For example, since summer 2019, Swiss shares may no longer be traded on trading venues in the EU. The suspension and resumption of price determination in individual securities will be announced on the website of the stock exchange gettex."
English,Broker,Trading,What are orders?,"Orders are instructions to buy or sell securities. By submitting your order in our app or online, you instruct Scalable Capital to place the corresponding order with Baader Bank for execution on gettex. The order is valid when the corresponding confirmation is displayed. You can follow the progress of your order live by checking the transaction list."
English,Broker,Trading,Which order types are available?,"There are four order types are available.

Market order: Executed during trading hours at the best possible price. This price may differ significantly from the last price at the time the order is placed due to price jumps. The market order is only valid for the trading day on which it was placed.

Limit order: Here you can define a limit price. The order will only be executed at this specified price or better. This allows you to protect yourself against sudden price jumps. On the other hand, it is possible that the limit order can only be partially executed or not executed at all.
The limit order is valid for 360 days. During this period it can be cancelled at any time, provided that not all of the ordered items have been executed.

Stop order: Here you can define a stop price. When the stop price is reached, your order will be activated as a market order and executed during trading hours at the best possible price. This price may differ significantly from the stop price due to price jumps. It can happen that the order is never active and therefore not executed. The stop order is valid for 360 days. During this period, it can be cancelled at any time, as long as not all of the ordered items have been executed.

Stop limit order: As a combination of the preceding two types of orders, you set both a limit and a stop price. When the stop price is reached, your order will be activated as a limit order and will then only be executed at the limit price or better. This allows you to protect yourself against sudden price jumps. However, it can happen that the order can only be executed partially or not at all. The stop limit order is valid for 360 days. During this period, it can be cancelled at any time, as long as not all of the ordered items have been executed."
English,Broker,Trading,Can I set up a One-Cancels-Other (OCO) order?,"No, Scalable Broker currently does not offer an OCO order.

Please note: If you enter both a stop and limit price in the order screen, this does not constitute an OCO order. A stop-limit order works as follows: When the stop price is reached, your order is activated as a limit order and then executed exclusively at the limit price or better. This way you can protect yourself against sudden price jumps. In return, it may happen that the order can only be partially executed or not at all."
English,Broker,Trading,Is there a minimum order value?,Trading starts at 0 Euro. This applies to trading via gettex and Xetra. Trades below 250 Euro of order value result in 0.99 Euro order fees per trade - applicable to all pricing tiers. Trades of 250 Euro or more are still included in the trading flat rate (PRIME and PRIME flex). A minimum order size of 250 Euro still applies when trading in derivatives.
English,Broker,Trading,Can I pay out sales proceeds immediately after selling securities?,"Yes. Proceeds from executed sales can be used directly to buy securities again. However, they are only available for payment once the trades have been booked by the custodian bank. This is due to the fact that securities transactions are only actually booked two trading days after the trade was concluded on the stock exchange (so-called settlement)."
English,Broker,Trading,How can I buy or sell a security?,"Trading orders can only be accepted in our app or online by logging in to your Scalable Capital account. Telephone orders in particular are not possible.

English,Broker,Trading,Can I change or cancel an order that I have already placed?,"A placed order can be cancelled free of charge under ""Transactions"" if it has not yet been fully executed. A direct modification of an order is not possible. If you want to change an order that has not yet been executed, cancel it and set it again."
English,Broker,Trading,Why is my order only partially executed?,"Trading on an exchange is determined by supply and demand. In principle, it can therefore happen with many types of orders that only a part of the ordered quantity can be executed, or nothing at all. Partial executions do not incur additional costs."
English,Broker,Trading,How do I set up a price alert?,"Click on the security that you want to set a price alert for.

English,Broker,Trading,Is it possible for my order to be cancelled following its execution?,"Yes, according to the Conditions for Transactions on the Munich Stock Exchange (IV. Section), trades can be cancelled retroactively by the exchange under certain conditions. This applies in particular to so-called mistrades. Mistrades can, for example, be caused by technical malfunctions or an obviously deviating reference price. In case of a cancellation of your already executed order, you will be informed by e-mail. Limit or stop orders will not be reactivated. Therefore, if necessary, please set the corresponding order again."

English,Broker,Savings plan,Why has my savings plan not yet been debited?,"The monthly savings plan is debited from your current account via SEPA direct debit. Please note that we will instruct the total sum of your savings plans at once. For example, if you have three active savings plans of 100 Euro each, we will debit 300 Euro. We instruct the payment on the last banking day of the previous month. The debit from your current account is usually made on the first bank working day of the month. Once credited to your broker account, the savings amount does not increase your cash balance, as it is reserved for the automatic purchase of that savings plan's corresponding ETF or stock.
"
English,Broker,Savings plan,Why does the savings rate not increase my balance?,"Once credited to your broker account, the savings amount will not increase your cash balance, as it is reserved for the automatic purchase of the savings plan's corresponding ETF or stock."
English,Broker,Savings plan,When will my savings plan be invested?,Your savings plans are invested at the most appropriate time during the execution day you choose when setting it up. You will see the purchase of securities on the following day in our app or online by logging in to your Scalable Capital account.
English,Broker,Savings plan,What happens if the price of the security is above or below my savings plan amount?,"With all savings plans, we also buy fractional shares of securities so that the determined savings plan amount can be reached. For example, if you have a savings plan of 50 Euros on an ETF that trades at 100 Euros at the time of purchase, your savings plan will buy 0.5 units. As long as the savings plan is active, these fractional shares are repeatedly combined into whole securities.

If you want to sell a security that was purchased with a savings plan and you therefore hold fractional shares, you can of course also sell the fractional shares again without additional costs. However, it is not possible to trade only a part of the held fractional shares. The entire position must always be sold."
English,Broker,Savings plan,Why isn't my entire savings plan invested?,"In order to invest your savings plan as fully as possible, we also buy fractional shares of ETFs. However, fractional shares can only be traded up to the third decimal place. To ensure that the savings rate is not exceeded, the fractional shares bought with your savings plan may therefore be rounded down.

Here's an example to make that clearer: You have set up a savings plan of 100 Euro on an ETF, which costs exactly 150 Euro at the time of purchase. If your savings plan buys 0.667 shares of this ETF for you, the costs would be higher than your savings plan at 100.05 Euro. Therefore, only 0.666 shares are bought and thus 99.90 Euro are invested. The remaining 0.10 Euro will be credited to your available balance."
English,Broker,Savings plan,Can I use capital-formation benefits (Vermögenswirksame Leistungen,Nein. Vermögenswirksame Leistungen können nicht über den Scalable Broker investiert werden.

English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,"Who can open an overnight, term, or flex deposit account?","The offer is available to all customers with a custody account at Baader Bank who have first opened a wealth management custody account and are a resident in Germany.

Customers who have opened the broker account first, even if they have subsequently created a wealth management portfolio, currently do not yet have access to the overnight, fixed, or flex deposit offers."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,What is an overnight deposit?,"Overnight deposits are a credit-based investment option in which you invest at a variable interest rate without a fixed term. As an investor, you can withdraw your savings amount or make additional deposits at any time. Overnight deposits offer flexibility and interest income at the same time. With overnight deposit offers, you receive interest payments monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, depending on the partner bank. Any interest income is reinvested in your overnight deposit account and thus bears interest in the next interest interval. Consequently, you benefit from the compound interest effect."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,What is an overnight deposit with a fixed savings amount?,"Overnight deposit offers which are marked with ""fixed savings amount,"" differ from conventional overnight deposit offers in the following points:

1. You decide on a fixed savings amount, which you deposit in one lump sum up front. You cannot subsequently top up the amount or have it partially paid out. You can only terminate the savings account in full.
2. After termination, which is possible at any time, the balance will be paid out to your reference account within the specified payout period. Interest will continue to accrue on your savings amount until the payout.
3. The interest is usually higher than for overnight deposit accounts without a fixed savings amount."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,What is a term deposit?,"Term deposits are investment products in which you invest a fixed amount for a fixed term at a fixed interest rate. Similar to overnight deposits, interest payments for term deposits can also be distributed at different points in time. Depending on the partner bank, interest is paid either at maturity or in certain intervals."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,What is a flex deposit?,"Flex deposits combine the benefits of term deposits and overnight deposits. Similar to term deposits, both a fixed term and a fixed interest rate are defined at the start. Due to the fixed term, the interest rate is typically higher than for overnight deposits but lower than for fixed term deposits with an equal term. However, with flex deposits you can terminate your contract anytime. In this case you would receive the interest rate for early termination, which is lower than the interest rate for the entire term. In summary, with flex deposits you benefit from a relatively high, fixed interest rate (compared to overnight deposits) over the entire term as well as from the short-term availability."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,How can I use this service?,"Scalable Capital provides access to overnight, term and flex deposits offered by partner banks of our cooperation partner Raisin.

English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,When and where will I be credited with interest?,"This depends on the contractual conditions of the respective partner bank. With overnight deposit offers, interest income is usually reinvested in your overnight deposit account and thus bears interest in the next interest interval. Consequently, you benefit from the compound interest effect. With term deposits, interest payments for can be distributed at different points in time. With some banks, interest is only paid out at maturity along with the savings amount. With other banks, you receive interest payments at certain intervals."
English,Overnight & term deposits,Overnight & term deposit accounts,How is my money protected? What are the risks?,"Raisin cooperates exclusively with partner banks located in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA). All EU member states have agreed to create national deposit guarantee schemes in accordance with European requirements. Countries within the EEA that are not members of the EU (e.g. Norway) have also set up deposit guarantee schemes.

These deposit guarantee schemes provide protection up to a certain savings amount (in the EU, generally up to an equivalent of 100,000 Euro), if a bank is unable to repay the deposits of its clients. This type of investment is therefore relatively safe up to this protection amount. Nevertheless, there are risks to be considered. In particular, these risks include issuing, transfer, and currency risks as well as legal risks. You can find further information (including information on the applicable rules of the respective deposit insurance) in the pre-contractual information and contractual terms of Raisin, Raisin Bank and the respective partner bank."

English,General,Security & privacy,Is Scalable Capital an independent and regulated company?,"Scalable Capital is an independent wealth manager, acting in the best interest of its clients. We are a financial services institution with the regulatory permission of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) for financial portfolio management (also called ""wealth management"") according to § 32 German Banking Act (KWG). We are subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and the Deutsche Bundesbank.

BlackRock, Inc. is (indirectly) a minority shareholder of the wealth manager's parent company. The wealth manager makes the selection of ETFs for the investment universe as an operational decision solely on the basis of objective criteria aligned with client interests. Thus, there are no economic incentives to favor certain ETFs, whether from BlackRock, Inc. or any other provider."
English,General,Security & privacy,How secure are my money and my investments? What happens in the event that Scalable Capital or your partner bank becomes insolvent?,"As a financial services institution, we are not authorized to obtain possession or ownership of the customer's assets. The customer's assets are held in the custody of our partner bank(s). In case of insolvency of Scalable Capital Vermögensverwaltung GmbH, the customer's assets contained in the custody account will therefore not fall into the insolvency estate of Scalable Capital Vermögensverwaltung GmbH.

In the event of the insolvency of the partner bank, your clearing account is protected by the statutory deposit protection of the Compensation Scheme of German Banks (Entschädigungseinrichtung deutsche Banken) up to a deposit amount of 100,000 Euro (see details on this at http://www.edb-banken.de/en/) and beyond that up to a certain amount by the deposit protection fund of the Association of German Banks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken). In addition, there is a claim to surrender of your securities in the portfolio in the event of insolvency of the custodian bank. This last aspect is particularly important for your investment with Scalable Capital Vermögensverwaltung GmbH, because your money is predominantly invested in securities with us and thus predominantly does not fall under the topic of deposit protection (like the cash on the clearing account).

As a regulated financial services institution, Scalable Capital Vermögensverwaltung GmbH is assigned to the Compensatory Fund of Securities Trading Companies (Entschädigungseinrichtung der Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen; EdW). The EdW provides compensation if an institution is no longer able to fulfill its ""liabilities from securities transactions"" to its customers for reasons directly related to its financial situation (and BaFin has determined the compensation case). For this compensation, the protection is limited to 90%, up to a maximum of 20,000 Euro per investor. Such a compensation case can only arise in special constellations for a financial services institution without permission to accept possession or ownership of assets of the customer (such as Scalable Capital Vermögensverwaltung GmbH); for example, the acceptance of customer funds despite the lack of the corresponding regulatory permission could be considered. Secondary claims (such as damages due to faulty investment) are generally not compensable."

English,Taxes,General questions,How does the final withholding tax work?,"The final withholding tax on investment income (capital gains tax, solidarity tax, and, where applicable, church tax) is paid on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The respective levies are withheld by the custodian bank after each sale, taking into account tax allowance and loss pots where applicable, and forwarded to the tax office.

This only applies to customers subject to taxation in Germany. Customers who have a tax residence outside of Germany are obliged to determine and pay the applicable taxes themselves. Scalable Capital cannot provide tax advisory services in this regard.

You can find the amount of withholding tax paid by you in your personal customer area. To do this, please log into your Scalable Capital account on our website, open the menu item ""Profile"" and click on ""Taxes""."
English,Taxes,General questions,How does the payment of the church tax work?,"After your registration, Baader Bank automatically queries your church tax status at the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern). If you are liable to pay church tax, the church tax will be paid directly to the tax office together with the capital gains tax and the solidarity tax on a transaction basis.

Please note that Baader Bank only checks your church tax status once a year in September for the following year. If your religious affiliation changes after this date, the change cannot be made during the year. The change will not be made until the next check in the following tax year. However, you can claim back any excess church taxes that have been paid when you file for your tax return. Please contact your tax advisor for this.

English,Taxes,General questions,When do I have to pay foreign withholding tax?,"The foreign withholding tax is comparable to the German capital gains tax, but is incurred directly at the ""source"" and, as a country-specific tax, depends on the respective country.

The amount of the country-specific withholding tax can be obtained from the Federal Central Tax Office. For further details, please contact your tax advisor.
"
English,Taxes,General questions,Is it possible to be exempted from withholding tax in advance or to have it reduced?,"For US withholding tax, the custodian bank (Baader Bank) can grant a lower tax rate as a Qualified Intermediary. A reduction of the withholding tax from 30% to 15% is possible if you are liable to pay tax in Germany. According to the double taxation treaty USA - Germany, the automatic reduction of the US withholding tax takes place for non-US persons with German citizenship, German residence and tax liability in Germany. For foreigners living in Germany the legitimation has to be done by Form W-8BEN. To do so, send us the completed form via e-mail to service@scalable.capital. Please make sure to provide complete information when submitting the form. If you are not taxable in Germany, the US withholding tax is regulated in the country-specific double taxation treaty between the USA and your tax country. For all other countries, an advance exemption from the respective withholding tax is not possible."
English,Taxes,General questions,When will the advance flat rate be debited?,"Broker: The advance fee is debited by the custodian bank at the beginning of the year. The debit will be made from your clearing account. Please ensure that there are sufficient funds in your account. If the booking of an advance fee results in a negative balance, the custodian bank may charge interest of 6.00% p.a. in accordance with the ""List of Prices and Services"" (p. 65).

Wealth management: The advance fee is debited by the custodian bank at the beginning of the year. The debit will be made from your clearing account. We will ensure that there are sufficient funds for you. You do not have to worry about anything in this regard."
English,Wealth management,Account opening,Is there a minimum investment?,"Yes. The minimum investment amount per portfolio is 10,000 Euro. If your investment volume should ever fall below the limit of 10,000 Euro, you required to deposit any money.

However, partial withdrawals that would reduce the investment amount below 10,000 Euro are not possible. In this case, you would have to terminate your contract and have your entire investment amount paid out."
English,Wealth management,Account opening,How does Scalable Capital choose a suitable investment strategy for me?,"As a regulated financial services institution, we are legally obliged to form a picture of your financial situation and other relevant circumstances.

The maximum risk category has been determined based on your investment objectives, your knowledge and experience, and your financial situation."
English,Wealth management,Additional portfolios,Can I transfer investments between my portfolios?,"You can make deposits and withdrawals in your portfolios at any time. Thus, you can also transfer investments from Portfolio 1 to Portfolio 2, for example. To do this, make a withdrawal to Portfolio 1. As soon as the money has been credited to your current account, you can order a deposit into Portfolio 2. This is possible via the Scalable Capital client area."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Is Scalable Capital an active wealth manager?,"No, not in the conventional sense. We offer passive investment with active risk management. Within the various asset classes (e.g. equities or bonds), we invest exclusively in passive ETFs and, where applicable, ETCs that track a specific market at the lowest possible cost. The weighting of the various asset classes is carried out dynamically on the basis of our investment and risk management technology on the one hand - and strategically on the basis of the management of the equity quota in our sustainable strategies on the other - and is thus active in the strictest sense.

We thus only make adjustments to your portfolio if your risk of loss is forecast to exceed or fall below a higher probability (dynamic risk management strategies) or if your portfolio weights deviate from the target weights (sustainable strategies). In this way, your investment risk is always controlled.

Unlike an active asset manager, we do not make portfolio reallocations based on opinions about the price performance of specific asset classes. An active asset manager selects individual stocks based on expected value growth (so-called stock picking). However, countless empirical studies show that this is not effective."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,How do ESG portfolios differ from VaR portfolios?,"With both portfolios, we take over asset management for you. This means that we make the investment decisions for you with regard to portfolio allocation and select suitable financial instruments for you. For both the ESG and VaR portfolios, we only use ETFs and ETCs for portfolio composition that meet our screening criteria such as high liquidity or low costs. In terms of portfolio composition, we also aim to achieve regional diversification across different asset classes for ESG and VaR portfolios. This helps to ensure diversification of risk.

While the VaR portfolios invest primarily in ETFs that track the most liquid benchmark indices, the ESG portfolios use ETFs that have defined sustainable indices as benchmarks. These are currently less liquid for this purpose.

Your ESG and VaR portfolio is continuously monitored by our investment technology. If movements in the market cause significant deviations from the target weights of your investment strategy, we automatically rebalance your ESG portfolio. Your desired equity quota between 0 and 100% is thus always restored. Optionally, you can add gold to your portfolio.
The VaR portfolios also include dynamic risk management. This means that the equity weighting is controlled by our risk management technology. In our highest risk category VaR 25, for example, the range of equity investments is 45% - 85%.

Our goal is to use sustainable ETFs in the VaR portfolios in the future as well. However, these will be subject to more frequent reallocations due to the dynamic risk model. Sustainable ETFs are not yet suitable for this purpose due to their lower liquidity. However, it is already possible to use them in the context of strategic management of the equity quota with target weightings. That is why we would like to make access possible for our customers with immediate effect."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,What is ESG?,"The abbreviation stands for ""Environmental, Social, Governance"", the consideration of environmental protection, social aspects and good corporate governance. In each of these three dimensions, companies are assessed according to a series of benchmarks:

E: Criteria such as commitment to combating climate change or protecting natural resources.
S: Aspects such as respect for human rights and exclusion of child labor.
G: Here, the focus is on anti-corruption and transparency, for example.

We select ETFs for you whose underlying index is composed according to the above criteria."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?,"""Value-at-Risk"" (VaR) is a widely used statistical risk measure in banking and insurance. VaR indicates the loss threshold that will not be exceeded with a certain probability within a given period of time.

The VaR used by Scalable Capital quantifies the annual loss that should not be exceeded with a probability of 95% (VaR with annual horizon and 95% confidence level).

For example, a stated VaR of 12% means that the portfolio should not lose more than 12% of its value in one year with a probability of 95%. In other words, an annual loss of more than 12% can occur on average in one year out of 20 (1/20, or 5% probability).

Example: For an investment amount of 50,000 Euro this means that on average every 20 years the loss in value could exceed 6,000 Euro."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Why do the risk classes at Scalable Capital have percentages and no explanatory designations?,"In the financial industry, investment strategies are often described with vague, intangible terms such as ""moderate"" or ""opportunity-oriented"". At Scalable Capital, we deliberately avoid these empty terms, which do not give investors any concrete information about the risks they are taking on with their investment.

Experience shows that financial market risks fluctuate considerably over time and increase significantly in times of crisis. A so-called ""moderate"" portfolio with an allocation of, say, 40% in equities and 60% in bonds may indeed have a ""moderate"" risk profile in absolute terms during a ""normal"" market phase. However, if equity and bond markets enter turbulence, the risk of loss can multiply. The designation ""moderate"" simply means that the risk is lower relative to a portfolio with ""opportunity-oriented"" risk, but in absolute terms it may nevertheless have increased sharply. Consequently, even so-called ""moderate"" investment strategies can suffer high, percentage losses.

At Scalable Capital, each risk category is instead assigned a specific risk of loss (VaR) or equity exposure (ESG). The risk of loss indicates the percentage annual loss that should not be exceeded with a probability of 95%. This risk measure is referred to as Value-at-Risk or VaR for short. A specified VaR of, for example, 12% then means that the portfolio should not lose more than 12% of its value in one year with a probability of 95%, or put another way, on average in one year out of 20 (1/20, i.e. 5% probability) an annual loss of more than 12% can occur. Our clients therefore know from the outset how much risk of loss they are taking - and this in absolute percentage terms, not relative to general market fluctuations. If this loss risk is threatened to be exceeded, a risk-reducing portfolio reallocation is automatically carried out. In the opposite case, in phases of relatively low market risk, a risk-increasing reallocation is made - subject to the agreed risk tolerance. This ensures that no potential returns are wasted due to an overly conservative portfolio structure. In this way, the investment risk is always dynamically controlled and does not simply fluctuate with the risks on the financial markets.

The equity quota reflects the target weighting of equities in the respective risk category, which we continuously restore through reallocations. The initial equity quota and the strategic orientation of your investment are thus ensured time and again.

In summary, risk is the currency with which investors buy returns. Our customers decide for themselves how much risk ""they want to put on the table""."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Can I lose more than the VaR of my portfolio?,"Yes. A loss or a temporary negative performance of your portfolio exceeding the VaR is not only possible, but even to be expected with a probability of 5%. This risk of loss exists regardless of the risk category you choose.

Example:
With a VaR of 12%, your portfolio is expected to lose no more than 12% in value on an annual basis with a probability of 95% (i.e., on average, 19 out of 20 years). However, with a 5% probability (i.e., once in 20 years on average), you can expect to lose more than 12% on an annual basis.

Further guidance regarding your risk can be found here."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,How broadly diversified is my portfolio?,"Risk diversification is essential for successful long-term investing. Scalable Capital invests globally in up to seven different asset classes representing up to 9,500 individual stocks from up to 90 countries. We exclusively use carefully selected Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and, if applicable, Exchange-Traded Commodities ETCs), which track the performance of various indices or a commodity (e.g. gold) at low cost.

Diversification is all the more effective the less the various investments in the portfolio move in sync. Our risk management technology takes into account the constantly changing interdependencies between asset classes to ensure that investors' portfolios are always optimally positioned, even in different market phases. In doing so, we use methods that go far beyond conventional correlation analysis, which is, however, useless in times of crisis. Further explanations for our dynamic risk management can be found in our whitepaper."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,How often is my portfolio adjusted?,"We make adjustments whenever the risk of your investment as calculated by us, threatens to deviate from the previously defined risk of loss (measured by VaR) or your portfolio weight deviates from the target weights (measured by the equity quota in our ESG portfolios).

For our sustainable strategies, we monitor on a daily basis whether the strategic target weights for your risk category, spread across asset classes and regions, are still met within your portfolio. If your portfolio weights deviate, we automatically rebalance this for you. The initial equity quota and the strategic orientation of your investment are thus always restored.

For our risk categories measured by VaR, we can additionally control the weights dynamically within a certain range, as the products selected for the portfolio are more liquid.

In detail, this is how it works for our dynamic risk management: Our risk management technology regularly reviews the risk of our customer portfolios. If the loss potential is forecast to be higher than that defined for the respective risk category, we reallocate from higher-risk asset classes (such as equities) to lower-risk asset classes (such as government bonds or money market funds). This does not mean that we immediately act frantically every time there is a price correction. But we do systematically adjust the portfolio to the market situation when it changes on a sustained basis. The aim is to protect investors from excessive stress and increase their chances of above-average returns. In calm market phases, in turn, rebalancing takes place in the opposite direction. We make adjustments whenever the risk we calculate for your investment threatens to deviate from the previously defined risk of loss (measured by VaR).

So we focus on managing risk. We do not try to predict returns. According to many empirical studies, this is not useful anyway. We therefore do not select individual stocks on the basis of expected value growth (so-called stock picking) and do not follow investment trends.

New investments are invested as soon as they are credited, but at the latest with the next rebalancing. In the process, we aggregate the orders to be executed for all customer portfolios. In this way, we minimize trading costs."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,I have a high risk category (VaR). Why is my share in equity ETFs so low?,"In order to comply with your risk specifications, your portfolio is continuously monitored and analyzed with regard to its risk potential. Therefore, in periods when equity markets do not have an attractive risk-return profile and there is a threat of your downside risk being exceeded, there may be a risk-reducing portfolio shift away from equity ETFs and towards bond ETFs. As soon as the markets calm down and the risk-return profile in the equity markets improves, equity ETFs will also be allocated to your portfolio again."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Can I change the investment strategy after registration?,"Yes. The investment strategy can be changed after enrollment. We have determined suitable investment strategies for you based on your investment objectives, knowledge and experience, and financial circumstances. If there have been any changes, you can run the suitability check again and adjust your risk category. You can also change your VaR portfolio to an ESG portfolio and vice versa free of charge.

To do so, please log in to the customer area and open the ""Profile"" section. Then select the ""Investment Strategy"" menu item, where you can run the suitability check again and adjust your risk category (VaR or ESG).

We recommend that a change of investment strategy should only be made if your circumstances have changed. For long-term wealth accumulation, it's important to be consistent with your investment strategy and not be tempted by daily events in the capital markets to act in the short term."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Where can I find information about distributions?,"A distinction is made between distributing and non-distributing ETFs, whereby distributing ETFs do not guarantee regular distributions. Distributions (e.g. dividends or interest) of the ETFs we use are credited to your settlement account and automatically reinvested by us."

English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,How does Scalable Capital's dynamic risk management work?,Video Input
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Who makes the investment decisions at Scalable Capital?,"For portfolio management, we use leading technology and the latest findings from capital market research and financial econometrics. Unlike an active asset manager, we do not make portfolio reallocations based on subjective opinions about price developments of specific asset classes. Portfolio adjustments are essentially the result of deviations in the loss risks or target weights of the current portfolios from our clients' chosen risk category.

However, the actual trading, i.e., the execution of securities orders, takes place by a real investment team, which reviews and bundles the securities orders and finally passes them on to our trading bank.

In this way, we ensure that there is still a human controller, but one that does not actively intervene in portfolio management, but rather develops, monitors and maintains the system."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,"Is it possible to not be invested at all, but at the same time leave the money with Scalable Capital?","In fact, one of our goals as an automated asset manager is precisely to avoid emotional wrong decisions, which are often made especially in difficult market phases. For this reason, there is no provision for a complete shift of the portfolio assets into overnight money at the customer's request. However, our investment model itself does not provide for a maximum limit for overnight money for portfolios with dynamic risk management (VaR), so a complete shift into overnight money is also conceivable in the event of extreme market turbulence."
English,Wealth management,Investment model & risk management,Is there a benchmark for investment strategies?,"Yes. There is a defined benchmark for each investment strategy. A Morningstar® fund category corresponding to the respective risk exposure is definied as the benchmark.
The benchmarks for the individual risk categories are included in the customer documents. You can also read through our contract documents."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,What exactly does Scalable Capital invest my money in?,"To offer you optimal risk diversification, we invest globally in all major asset classes for you: Equities, government bonds, collateralized bonds (Pfandbriefe and covered bonds), corporate bonds, real estate, commodities and money market.

To gain access to these asset classes, we invest exclusively in exchange-traded funds (""ETFs"" or also known as ""index funds""), which track up to seven asset classes with up to 9,500 individual securities from up to 90 countries.

An overview of the selection process and the currently selected ETFs can be found in the Investment Universe section. The investment universe of our sustainable portfolios can be found here."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,What are ETFs?,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that replicate the performance of a stock market index, such as the DAX, without a fund manager making active investment decisions. They are therefore also known as passive index funds. Like an investment fund, an ETF gives you access to a broader set of securities. such as stocks. Unlike actively managed investment funds, however, they are much more cost-effective, because they do not require expensive management fees or premiums that eat up your return. Since ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, they also offer daily liquidity. In short: ETFs enable broadly diversified and cost-effective investments."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,How does Scalable Capital select the ETFs used in portfolios?,"ETFs are selected through an extensive, multi-stage process. The most important quantitative and qualitative selection criteria are:

Low costs - Avoiding costs is one of the most important criteria for long-term investment success. When selecting ETFs, we pay particular attention to the Total Expense Ratio (TER) metrics, which indicates the total cost of tracking the index, and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which takes into account external trading costs such as bid-ask spreads, taxes and brokerage fees.

High liquidity - ETFs with low trading liquidity tend to have wider bid-ask spreads, which increases trading costs. We look for ETFs with large asset sizes and multiple market makers to ensure the best possible tradability and minimize trading costs.

Low tracking error - Tracking error indicates the accuracy of index tracking. We look for low deviation of ETF performance from the underlying index to achieve the most accurate representation of the intended investment market.

Appropriate diversification - ETFs usually track very broad market indices, with dozens, and often hundreds or thousands, of individual stocks. This broad diversification of risk provides access to the fundamental return drivers of each asset class without accepting high individual risk. On the other hand, very broad-based indices contain a so-called long tail, i.e. a number of smaller companies with lower liquidity and thus higher trading costs. Our selection process pays attention to a balanced and favorable ratio of risk diversification and implied trading costs of the ETFs.

Safe replication method - ETFs are offered in two basic designs: with physical and synthetic replication of the underlying index.

In physical replication, the index is replicated by purchasing the individual index components (for example, the 30 individual stocks of the DAX).

In synthetic replication, the ETF provider enters into an agreement in the form of an exchange transaction (""swap"") with an investment bank, under which the exact performance of the desired index is guaranteed. Thus, a swap-based ETF does not directly include the underlying stocks. We pay attention to the use of physically replicating ETFs in our selection. Only in the commodities asset class, which tracks a broad basket of commodities, are ETFs with synthetic replication used, as commodity ETFs cannot be represented with physical replication. We invest in gold via an ETC (exchange-traded commodity). This security, an exchange-traded debt security, is backed by physical gold that is held securely for you in a bank vault.

Sustainability - Wherever possible, we use sustainable ETFs. These ETFs usually have additions such as ""ESG"" or ""ESG Screened"" in their name. This indicates to ETF providers that sustainability criteria are taken into account in the composition of an ETF. This leads, for example, to the exclusion of arms manufacturers or tobacco companies.

An overview of the ETFs currently used can be found in the Investment Universe section. The investment universe of our sustainable portfolios can be found here."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,"Why are individual ETFs in my portfolio marked as ""phase-out""?","If Scalable Capital identifies a more suitable ETF in an asset class, the exchange for existing customers is carried out gradually. In contrast to a one-time sale of all old shares, an additional tax expense can be reduced in this way, if necessary.

Additional purchases in the event of further deposits or a higher target weighting of these asset classes are made exclusively in the new ETF, while sales always first reduce the holdings of the old product. The old fund is indicated to the customer by the marking ""Phase-Out""."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,Is there a minimum investment period for my account or a minimum term for my contract?,"No. There is no minimum holding period or minimum term. Our service can be cancelled at any time. We invest exclusively in ETFs with exchange day tradability to provide you with the best possible liquidity.

However, a longer investment horizon can be advantageous for the investment and reduce investment risks. Especially in the case of negative performance, a longer holding period increases the likelihood that the portfolio can recover."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,How much money should I invest?,Investing in the capital market comes with risks. We therefore advise our clients to keep an immediately available emergency reserve for unforeseen events which should cover all of your current expenses and obligations for at least six months.
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,Does Scalable Capital also consider tax criteria when selecting ETFs?,"Yes. Tax criteria are also taken into account when selecting ETFs. As we also explain here, the tax treatment of ETFs for private investors has been significantly simplified by the Investment Tax Act (InvStG) 2018. Domestic and foreign funds are now taxed according to the same system, so since the beginning of 2018, unlike under the old tax regime, foreign accumulating funds are now also used.

The tax burden is paid directly by the custodian bank. This means that there is no additional expense for the private investor in the tax return."
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,Do you also invest in Short ETFs?,No. We currently invest exclusively in long-only ETFs. An overview of all ETFs used can be found in our current investment universe.
English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,Are you tied to specific ETFs when investing due to commission agreements? ,"We do not receive kickbacks (reimbursements) or commissions, as we believe that only a truly independent asset management company can act in the best interest of the client.

English,Wealth management,Investment universe & ETF selection,What happens if an ETF provider declares becomes insolvent?,"Should an ETF provider become insolvent, the assets managed by the ETF are protected from insolvency by their status as special assets. In the course of the insolvency proceedings, the insolvency estate as well as the claims of the creditors against this insolvency estate are determined and the creditors are served according to their claim. The assets managed by ETFs do not become part of the insolvency estate and are thus protected from access by the creditors of the investment company. Only the holders of the unit certificates of the ETFs are entitled to their pro rata share of the assets managed by the ETF."
English,Wealth management,Costs,What are the total costs of using Scalable Capital?,"The costs of the investment services consist of the remuneration of the asset manager, ""Scalable Capital"", and the transaction fee for the securities trading of the custodian bank and add up to 0.75% p.a.. The calculation is made daily on the basis of the average client assets under management, and the settlement is made monthly, separate for the asset manager and the custodian bank. The debit is made from your clearing account at the custodian bank. There are no further costs, e.g. for account and custody account management. There are also no hidden costs, issue surcharges or other commissions. For details, please refer to our list of prices and services.

The costs of the financial instruments (ETFs) add up to 0.15% p.a. They are already included in the market prices and would therefore also be borne by investors who trade in securities themselves. It is expected that these costs will fluctuate over time and there may be spikes in turbulent markets.

Custody account management is free of charge."

English,Wealth management,Reporting & taxes,How is the percentage return calculated in the account summary?,"To calculate the percentage return in your personal area at https://de.scalable.capital/login, we use the time-weighted method. The time-weighted return is adjusted for inflows and outflows and thus allows a direct comparison with a benchmark or another portfolio.

To calculate the time-weighted return, the entire investment period is broken down into different time periods. Whenever a deposit or withdrawal occurs, the return up to that point is calculated and a new period begins. To obtain the time-weighted return for the entire investment period, the returns for each period are multiplicatively linked."
English,Wealth management,Reporting & taxes,Why is my percentage return different from my absolute return?,"The time-weighted return shown in the account summary is adjusted for deposits and withdrawals. Therefore, your portfolio may have a positive or negative percentage return as the underlying portfolio has moved positively or negatively over time, but your absolute return may still be negative or positive. This often occurs if the majority of your portfolio was deposited and invested at a relative market high or low.

Two extreme examples:
You have an initial investment amount of 10,000 Euro invested with us. Subsequently, the market rises by 50% and your portfolio increases to a value of 15,000 Euro. Now let's assume you were to deposit an additional 1,000,000 Euro into your portfolio and the market immediately fell by 10%. In this case, your portfolio would lose over 100,000 Euro in value (significantly more than your initial gain of 5,000 Euro). Nevertheless, the percentage performance of your portfolio would be positive (increased by 50% and only decreased by 10%).
